## What I used
To make my powerful workflow and develop more easily, I used some tools which allowed me to avoid repetitive task.

#### Node js
Essentially to get the Node Package Manager and download the second tool. <br/>
[Nodejs.com](http://nodejs.org/) & [Npm.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)

#### Gulp
Gulp is the new Grunt. It does the dirty work for you ! Like compiling sass, compressing images, minify css and js, ... <br/>
[Gulp.com](http://gulpjs.com/) & (for the curious ones) [Grunt.com](http://gruntjs.com/)

#### Sass
Because coding pure css is such a waste of time. <br/>
[Sass.com](http://sass-lang.com/)

#### Compass CSS Framework
I don't think I need to explain why. <br/>
[Compass.com](http://compass-style.org/)

#### Knacss CSS Framework
All the generic classes already made. Responsive grid. French framework :fr: <br/>
[Knacss.com](http://www.knacss.com/)

#### Composer
It includes all the files and create an autoloader, so it's hugely useful. <br/>

#### Twig
My favorite template engine. Easy and really flexible tool ! <br/>

#### Git
And finally I use git, even if I'm the only developer, it allows me to have an historic. <br/>
